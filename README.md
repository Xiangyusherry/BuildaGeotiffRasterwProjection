# BuildaGeotiffRasterwProjection
To construct a GeoTiff raster with a known projection and coordinate.

# The source of the known projection and coordinate
In some situations, one needs to extract the raster data from ArcGIS or another geospatial analysis app and run complicated calculations, analyses, or predictions in another environment, say Python.
After the processing, the data can be constructed to GeoTiff with the same projection and coordinate.
